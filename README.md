This repository stores examples of Espresso autotests for the UHABITS application: https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits.git 
Autotests were created by me for educational purposes, in the process of learning the Espresso framework using the Kotlin language.
The repository is gradually being updated with new tests. 
All id and other source data of the HABITS application are given in their original form.
